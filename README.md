# 📊 Simple Sales Dashboard

This project is a basic interactive sales dashboard built using Power BI (simulated here with Python/Matplotlib for demo purposes).

## 📁 Files Included

- `Superstore_Sales.csv` – Sample sales data including Order Date, Region, Category, Sales, and Profit.
- `Sales_Dashboard.pdf` – A PDF snapshot of the dashboard including:
  - Line chart of Monthly Sales
  - Bar chart by Region
  - Donut chart by Category
- `Insights.md` – Key business insights based on the dashboard.

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights

- Analyze sales trends over time
- Compare regional performance
- Visualize category-wise sales share
- Filter-friendly layout (in full Power BI version)

## 🧠 Key Insights

1. The West region recorded the highest total sales, especially strong in Q3.
2. Technology category outperformed others in both sales and profit.
3. Sales peaked in November and December, likely due to holiday promotions.
4. The South region showed consistent growth month-over-month, indicating a stable customer base.

## 🚀 How to Use

You can use the dataset to recreate the dashboard in **Power BI** or **Tableau** by:
1. Importing the CSV file.
2. Converting `Order Date` to "Month-Year".
3. Creating charts and slicers as guided in the project.
